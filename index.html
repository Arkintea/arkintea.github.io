        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a full-stack data scientist passionate about extracting insights from complex datasets, with expertise in data collection, preprocessing, 
          modelling, and visualization. I possess a comprehensive skill set to tackle end-to-end data challenges. My experience in statistics and machine 
          learning allows me to develop robust predictive models, and my proficiency in programming languages enables me to build scalable data pipelines 
          and deploy machine learning solutions. By leveraging my strong analytical and problem-solving abilities, I drive data-driven decision-making, 
          optimize processes, and deliver valuable business solutions. With a commitment to continuous learning and innovation, I thrive in interdisciplinary 
          environments and excel at translating data into meaningful strategies.</p>

            <h2>IoT Data Pipeline</h2>
            <p>Data pipeline for IoT sensor fault detection data stream using Kafka and PySpark 
                (<a href="https://github.com/Arkintea/ml-data-pipeline-main">GitHub Link</a>)</p>

            <h2>Housing Price Prediction</h2>
            <p>End-to-End housing price prediction software using MLOps along with deployment using Github Action, Dockers, 
            Heroku, MongoDB and Python (<a href="https://github.com/Arkintea/Project-Housing_Prediction">GitHub Link</a>)</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Sensor Fault Detection</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on trucks' Air Pressure System (APS), which generates pressurized air for braking and gear 
                changes. The goal is to reduce costs by minimizing false predictions and unnecessary repairs. 
                (<a href="https://github.com/Arkintea/IoT-Sensor-Fault-Detection">GitHub Link</a>)</p>
            
        <div class="project">
            <h2>Insurance Premium Prediction</h2>
            <p>This app predicts Insurance premium prices based on some data. The goal of this project is to give people an 
                estimate of how much they need based on their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with 
                any health insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our study in mind. 
                This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an insurance policy rather than the ineffective part.

            <h2>Algerian Fire Prediction</h2>
            <p>Deployed a machine learning model to predict the presence of fire in Algeria based on various parameters like 
                humidity, temperature, etc. based on an Algerian dataset.

            <h2>CNN deep learning classifier pipeline</h2>
            <p>Deployed a deep learning classifier model using Python, Keras, TensorFlow, MLflow, DVC and Dockers to classify animals as dog or cat
