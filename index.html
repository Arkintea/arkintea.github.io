      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>As a Data Scientist, I specialize in solving complex business problems through the analysis of large
        and complex data sets. I am proficient in programming, statistics, data, mining, manipulation and
        wrangling, A/B testing, data visualization, machine learning modelling, product deployment, working
        with APIs, computer vision and NLP problems using various tools like SQL, Python, PySpark, Kafka,
        TensorFlow, PowerBI, Snowflake, MongoDB, numpy, pandas, seaborn, Scikit-learn, Scipy, Matplotlib,
        etc. My expertise in data cleaning, feature engineering, and model optimization has enabled me to
        build accurate models that improve business processes and drive revenue growth. I am a detailoriented
        problem-solver with excellent communication skills, committed to developing data-driven
        solutions that provide tangible value to stakeholders</p>

        <h3>Project 1: Predicting House Prices</h3>
        <p>Deployed a machine learning model to predict the presence of fire in Algeria based on various
            parameters like humidity, temperature, etc. based on an Algerian dataset.</p>

        <h3>Insurance Premium Prediction</h3>
        <p>This app predicts Insurance premium price based on some data. The goal of this project is to give 
            people an estimate of how much they need based on their individual health situation. After that, 
            customers can work with any health insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the 
            projected cost from our study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health 
            side of an insurance policy rather han the ineffective part.</p>
